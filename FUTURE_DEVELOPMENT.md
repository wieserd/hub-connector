# Future Development for hubspot-connector

This document outlines potential enhancements and features that could be added to the `hubspot-connector` to further expand its capabilities and utility.







## 4. Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests

Although placeholder test files exist, writing a full suite of unit and integration tests is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of the `hubspot-connector`.

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and methods (e.g., `HubSpotClient` methods, Pydantic model validation).
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the API endpoints end-to-end, ensuring the connector correctly interacts with the HubSpot API (using mock HubSpot responses for controlled testing).

## 5. Rate Limiting for the Connector

To protect the `hubspot-connector` itself from being overwhelmed by too many requests from external applications, implementing internal rate limiting can be beneficial.

*   This would prevent a single misbehaving client from consuming all resources and impacting other integrations.



## 7. Containerization (Docker)

Providing Docker support would greatly simplify the deployment and management of the `hubspot-connector`.

*   **Dockerfile:** A Dockerfile to build a container image for the application.
*   **Docker Compose:** A `docker-compose.yml` file for easy local development and testing with dependent services (if any).
*   **Deployment Guides:** Instructions for deploying the Dockerized application to various environments (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run).
